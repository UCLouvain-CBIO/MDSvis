              analysis of the effects of bioactive molecules on human samples
              at single-cell resolution, but instruments process only one
              sample at a time. Here we describe mass-tag cellular barcoding
              (MCB), which increases mass cytometry throughput by using n metal
              ion tags to multiplex up to 2n samples. We used seven tags to
              multiplex an entire 96-well plate, and applied MCB to
              characterize human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)
              signaling dynamics and cell-to-cell communication, signaling
              variability between PBMCs from eight human donors, and the
              effects of 27 inhibitors on this system. For each inhibitor, we
              measured 14 phosphorylation sites in 14 PBMC types at 96
              conditions, resulting in 18,816 quantified phosphorylation levels
              from each multiplexed sample. This high-dimensional,
              systems-level inquiry allowed analysis across cell-type and
              signaling space, reclassified inhibitors and revealed off-target
              effects. High-content, high-throughput screening with MCB should
              be useful for drug discovery, preclinical testing and mechanistic
              investigation of human disease.",

  abstract = "Benchmarking is a crucial step during computational analysis and
              method development. Recently, a number of new methods have been
              developed for analyzing high-dimensional cytometry data. However,
              it can be difficult for analysts and developers to find and
              access well-characterized benchmark datasets. Here, we present
              HDCytoData, a Bioconductor package providing streamlined access
              to several publicly available high-dimensional cytometry
              benchmark datasets. The package is designed to be extensible,
              allowing new datasets to be contributed by ourselves or other
              researchers in the future. Currently, the package includes a set
              of experimental and semi-simulated datasets, which have been used
              in our previous work to evaluate methods for clustering and
              differential analyses. Datasets are formatted into standard
              SummarizedExperiment and flowSet Bioconductor object formats,
              which include complete metadata within the objects. Access is
              provided through Bioconductor's ExperimentHub interface. The
              package is freely available from
              http://bioconductor.org/packages/HDCytoData.",

  abstract = "Quality Control (QC) of samples is an essential preliminary step
              in cytometry data analysis. Notably, identification of potential
              batch effects and outlying samples is paramount, to avoid
              mistaking these effects for true biological signal in downstream
              analyses. However, this task can prove to be delicate and tedious,
              especially for datasets with many samples. Here, we present
              CytoMDS, a Bioconductor package implementing a dedicated method
              for low dimensional representation of cytometry samples composed
              of marker expressions for up to millions of single cells. This
              method allows a global representation of all samples of a study,
              with one single point per sample, in such a way that projected
              distances can be visually interpreted. It uses Earth Mover's
              Distance for assessing dissimilarities between multi-dimensional
              distributions of marker expression, and Multi Dimensional Scaling
              for low dimensional projection of distances. Some additional
              visualization tools, both for projection quality diagnosis and for
              user interpretation of the projection coordinates, are also
              provided in the package. We demonstrate the strengths and
              advantages of CytoMDS for QC of cytometry data on three real
              biological datasets, revealing the presence of low quality
              samples, batch effects and biological signal between sample
