              particular, inhibition of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)
              has been found to be effective for the treatment of metastatic
              melanoma and other cancers. Despite a dramatic increase in
              progression-free survival, a large proportion of patients do not
              show durable responses. Therefore, predictive biomarkers of a
              clinical response are urgently needed. Here we used
              high-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry and a bioinformatics
              pipeline for the in-depth characterization of the immune cell
              subsets in the peripheral blood of patients with stage IV
              melanoma before and after 12 weeks of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.
              During therapy, we observed a clear response to immunotherapy in
              the T cell compartment. However, before commencing therapy, a
              strong predictor of progression-free and overall survival in
              response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy was the frequency of
              CD14+CD16-HLA-DRhi monocytes. We confirmed this by conventional
              flow cytometry in an independent, blinded validation cohort, and
              we propose that the frequency of monocytes in PBMCs may serve in
              clinical decision support.",

              researchers in the future. Currently, the package includes a set
              of experimental and semi-simulated datasets, which have been used
              in our previous work to evaluate methods for clustering and
              differential analyses. Datasets are formatted into standard

abstract = {ABSTRACT Quality Control (QC) of samples is an essential preliminary step in cytometry data analysis. Notably, the identification of potential batch effects and outlying samples is paramount to avoid mistaking these effects for true biological signals in downstream analyses. However, this task can prove to be delicate and tedious, especially for datasets with dozens of samples. Here, we present CytoMDS, a Bioconductor package implementing a dedicated method for low-dimensional representation of cytometry samples composed of marker expressions for up to millions of single cells. This method allows a global representation of all samples of a study, with one single point per sample, in such a way that projected distances can be visually interpreted. CytoMDS uses Earth Mover's Distance for assessing dissimilarities between multi-dimensional distributions of marker expression and Multi-Dimensional Scaling for low-dimensional projection of distances. Some additional visualization tools, both for projection quality diagnosis and for user interpretation of the projection coordinates, are also provided in the package. We demonstrate the strengths and advantages of CytoMDS for QC of cytometry data on three real biological datasets, revealing the presence of low-quality samples, batch effects, and biological signal between sample groups.},
